# Cost-function for Erlang (And elixir) 

If you have something to separate your elevators from each other (When using =:=), you can get the cost for taking an order by:

```[Erlang]
1> cost_function:get( {"My elevator", 1, up}, {"Other elevator", 1, hall_down}, 4).
6
>2 
```

To add the cost-function to a rebar3-project, simply add the line/modify the deps-part of rebar.config to look like:
```
{deps, [
    {cost_function, {git, "https://github.com/jornbh/erlang_cost_function", {tag, "0.1.0"}}}
]}.
```
If you want to use the library in an Elixir-project, modify `deps()` in mix.exs, so that it includes: 

```[Elixir]
  defp deps do
    [

      {:erlang_cost_function, git: "https://github.com/jornbh/erlang_cost_function", tag: "v0.1.0"},

    ]
  end
```

There is slightly more info on how the module works in the [documentation generated by `rebar3 edoc`](https://jornbh.github.io/erlang_cost_function/doc/index.html).
